I am a PhD student at the [iSchool](https://ischool.umd.edu) of the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/), working with Prof. [Ge Gao](http://gegao.info/). Prior to joining UMD, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge advised by Dr. [Hatice Gunes](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~hg410/) in 2019, and my Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Industrial Engineering (major) and Finance (minor) from Tsinghua University in 2018. 

Outside of school, I have worked in the Innovation Engineering Group (IEG) at Microsoft Research Asia and Malong Technologies.

My research interests lie in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) with specific focuses on computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), social computing, and affective computing. I conduct research that aims to gain insights about how information/technologies influence our lives, health, and happiness, design systems to facilitate communication and collaboration, and help people from diverse groups feel more comfortable with and in control of technologies in various contexts. My research draws on implementing computational methods with qualitative methods to study peoples' social and emotional behaviors in interactions while considering their personalities and cultural backgrounds.
